filereverse
===========

An example of using a servlet to allow upload of file and download its reversed content.

webapp contains the unpacked war for the example or you can download the
whole .war from the "downloads".  Just drop it into the Tomcat webapps
directory and access it at http://yourhost/FileReverse.

This is a simple (aka crude) example of how to do multipart form uploads,
storing a file, and downloading a processed version of the file.
